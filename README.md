# FIRST Robotics Java Template
Template repository for FIRST Robotics Competition Java codebases, developed for FRC Team Biohazard 4050 but easily adaptable to other teams needs.

# Getting started

## Development 

This repository is designed to be used 1 of 2 ways:

1. Devcontainer Mode
2. Desktop Mode

Both have pros and cons, detailed below, but TLDR: If you are planning on doing any testing or robot deployment, use desktop. Otherwise, feel free to use the container.
